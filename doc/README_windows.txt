BitGreen Core
=====================

Intro
-----
BitGreen (BITG) is a sustainable cryptocurrency modeled after
Satoshi Nakamotoâ€™s vision for Bitcoin. It is a decentralized,
peer-to-peer transactional currency designed to offer a solution to the problem posed
by the exponential increase in energy consumed by Bitcoin and other proof-of-work currencies.
Proof-of-work mining is environmentally unsustainable due to the electricity used by
high-powered mining hardware. BitGreen utilizes an energy efficient proof-of-stake algorithm,
can be mined on any computer, and will never require specialized mining equipment.
The Green Protocol offers a simple solution to Bitcoin sustainability issues and provides a faster,
more scalable blockchain that is better suited for daily transactional use.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run bitgreen-qt.exe.

BitGreen Core is the original BitGreen client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of BitGreen transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.
